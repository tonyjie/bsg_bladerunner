Hi,

To Run this code:
1. Set up the bsg replicant environment
2. Copy the code to the 
        /bsg_bladerunner_zhang/bsg_bladerunner/bsg_replicant/examples/cuda/
3. If the environment is set up correctly the example can be run by typing 
    make exec.log
4. To change the number of loops/iterations you have to change the variable iter_max in the main.cpp 
   and the bound for the inner loop in kernel.cpp. (the inner loop inside the inner loop comments are left there indicating what to change)
